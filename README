TASK: HSHEX MONO COMP


In order to run the program on either a LINUX machine or WSL, use the following commands on your terminal, pressing
enter after each one. 

Firstly, ensure all relevant hshex files are present on your directory and you have permission to access them.

1. gcc -o process process.c
(compile the program)

2. ./process "imagename.hxhex" "new output file name"
e.g ./process coffee.hshex coffenew
(applying and running the code on our images)

3. chmod +x hsconvert
(makes the file executable, so you can run run it as a program)

4. ./hsconvert -f PPM input_file output_file.ppm
e.g ./process coffeenew coffeenew.ppm
(running "hsconvert: on the new file created and turning it into a ppm to visualise the image. Make sure relevant ppm files are installed and present during the compilation and running of the code.)

To run multiple files:
5. ./process "imagenameone.hshex" "imagenameoneoutput" "imagenametwo.hshex" "imagenametwooutput" *as many as you please*
